# Things To Remember
- Variables can override the ones present in parent scope
- error if var already present in current scope
-  Variables being declared as being the void type.
-  array indexed with more indices than its dimension and functions being passed with lesser than required number of parameters. 
- All forms of scoping errors.
- Field access (x.f) applied to non structure/union variables (x in this case) or to a structure/union variable without having the appropriate field (f in this case).
